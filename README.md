# python_delivery_slc   
A python console application that uses a greedy algorithm to deliver packages. 
There are 27 destination where 40 packages must be delivered by three trucks. Certain packages have 
special needs, such as only being on truck 2, being delayed, or must be delivered 
before a certain time.  The combined mileage of all trucks must be less than 
140 miles.

I didn't use an IDE for this. I wrote this in Notepad++. To run the app, install 
a python interpreter. From a console run `python main.py`.
